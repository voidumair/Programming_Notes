<------ NODE & EXPRESS ------>
------ Learn What Matters ------
	1. Express or Node what is the main lead
			-> both are main roles but express cannot be run without Node.
			-> Node needs express to handle requests and responses and routes.

	2. What is express
			-> Node gives HTTP to make server but its code is diffcult.
			-> Express also makes server but its easier to handle.
			-> BTS Express also uses HTTP.


	3. What is Routing
			-> routes are url after /
			-> /contact is a route
			-> coding routes is routing

	4. request, response, next
			-> req: request mai user ka data hota hai (user location, device info etc...)
			-> res: response mai controls hote hain jinki basis pr hm server se response bej patay hain
			-> next: next is a push so that our request moves to next thing which should be executed

	5. Route Parameters
			-> /:slug
			-> to make route dynamic you can use : at place where you want to make it dynamic and to access there value use ${req.params.slug}

	6. Template Engines
			-> ye style of markup se convert kr k HTML dete hain
			-> ejs, pug, handlebars
			-> using ejs 
					> npm i ejs
					> app.set("view engine","ejs");
					> make a folder named "views"
					> make .ejs file inside views
					> write res.render("./views/index.ejs") => render krte waqat makesure to use files in views folder and remove ./views and .ejs just res.render("index")

	7. Static Files
			-> images, stylesheets, frontend javascripts
			-> Setting up static files
					> make a folder named "public"
					> create 3 folders inside it "images , stylesheets, javascripts(frontend js)"
					> app.use(express.static("public)); in backend file
					> res.send("../public/stylesheets/style.css") => remove public res.send("../stylesheets/style.css") => "../" is same as "/" => res.send("/stylesheets/style.css")
					> we can also use static files in ejs file by linking them

	8. error handling
			-> try-catch and other considerations
			
------ Master The Art ------
	1. Express Genrator
		-> it will make the folder structure for you and it will also write the basic code for the project.
		-> it creates a folder and do everything inside that. we dont need to make main folder.
		-> Steps to use express genrator
			-> Install Globally (npm i express-generator -g)
			-> (express [appname] --view=ejs)
			-> (cd [appname])
			-> (npm i)
			-> open in VS Code
			-> Changes:
				-> app.get => router.get
				-> nodemon filename.js => nodemon

	2. MongoDB
		<Code Side>        ---         <MongoDB Side>
			DB Setup                     DB Formation
			Model                        Collection
			Schema                       Documents
		
			-> Install MongoDB
			-> Install mongoose
			-> import and setup connection
			-> make schema
			-> create model and export (practiced in users.js in views folder)

	2. Cookies and Sessions
		<Client (user's browser)>        ---         <Server>
			Cookies                                 Session
			-> both are used to save user's data
			-> Cookie : 
					Saves data on clients browser (cookie-parser) (handled using req and res (res to send data to user's browser. req to recieve data from user ) )
			-> Session : 
					Saves data on server (express-session) (handled using req cz user ki traf se anay wala data req mai hota hai)
			-> if server restarts session deletes.
			-> session value set in one route can accesed in any route (practiced in app.js)

------ The End Game ------
	1. Flash Messages
		-> Flash ka mtlab hai srever k kisi route p data bnana aur uss data ko kisi aur route mai use kr pana
			-> install connect-flash
			-> put connect-flash in app.use()
			-> kisi b route main flash create kren
			-> kisi b doosre route pr app.use() chalany ka try kren
			-> NOTE: YOU CAN'T USE CONNECT-FLASH WITHOUT EXPRESS-SESSION

	2. Mongoose intermediate
		-> case insenstive search
			-> RegExp("name","flags") [^start $end]
		-> find data in which array contains all of a set of values
			-> {FeildData:{$all:[1,3]}}
		-> find data in which array contains all of a set of values
			-> {FeildData:{$all:[1,3]}}
		-> Search between date range
			-> {"dateCreated":{$gte:date2,$lte:date1}}
		-> Search if field exists
			-> {"dateCreated":{$exists:true}}
		-> specific field length
			-> see in (user.js)

	2. Authentication and Authorization
		-> Steps to follow:
				-> install these packages:
					-> npm i express-session mongoose passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose
				-> write app.js code first (write it after view engine and before logger)
				-> setup users.js properly
				-> in index.js try register first and then other codes as well
